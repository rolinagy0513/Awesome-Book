üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Frontend:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
React.js

Backend (Currently Non-Functional):

API designed for book renting operations, written in C# .NET.
Note: The backend API for this application is not currently operational due to financial reasons.

üéØ Purpose

The primary intention of this project was to help me learn the fundamentals of fetching data from an
API, as well as to gain experience in teamwork and effective communication with backend developers.

üìÑ Configuration

About the port configuration 

  -The API currently works only on port 4735.
  
About the .env.example File

  -The .env.example file is used for storing sensitive environmental variables that should not be shared with others, such as API keys and endpoint URLs.

How Does It Work?

Rename the file:

Rename the file from .env.example to .env so that GitHub will ignore it.

Change the placeholders:

Replace the placeholder values (e.g., your_api_key_here) with your actual API key.

Update the URLs for the following operations:

VITE_BOOK_API_URL_AUTH: The base URL for authorization operations.

VITE_BOOK_API_URL_BOOK: The base URL for book-related operations.

Notes

  .Keep the .env file secure and avoid sharing it in public repositories.
  
  .Use the .env.example file as a template for future developers to configure their own environment variables.
